# Express-API-Project
This provides an API using Express to GET/POST a Json file which can  be edited in a client-side application.
This is used by the bootcamp fron-end project clientpage_project.
The server is deployed in production at https://adminapi-jeu0.onrender.com.
It was deployed here because otherwise the server has to reside on  the local machine (127.0.0.1:3000) and when someone different accesses the front end they are unable to cnnect to this localhost address on  my machine.
